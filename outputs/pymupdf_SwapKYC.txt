4. ONBOARDING 
4.1 What does the onboarding process entail? 
Onboarding refers to the process of gathering information from a potential participant/ service 
provider, assessing the information provided against external data sources and making a 
decision/ judgement based on predefined criteria on the suitability & viability of the applicant 
in relation to the organizational risk appetite. This process is also commonly known as the 
vetting process. Compliance to legislative and regulatory standards is of utmost importance 
and an irrefutable part of the decision-making process.  
The vetting process typically falls within 2 categories i.e., i) Soft Vetting and ii) Extreme Vetting 
4.2 Soft Vet 
This is an investigative process in which preliminary checks are performed on a prospective 
entity. A soft vet allows the organization to perform an initial assessment to determ

4.5 Onboarding steps 
The procedure to follow when conducting a compliance vet, can be found in the steps 
articulated below.   
Step 1: The Compliance team will receive a request from Business Development for a new 
onboarding. The initial request will be for a soft vet in which case if successful, an extreme 
betting must be conducted.  
Step 2: It is recommended for each request to be acknowledged. Not only is it polite and builds 
report, but it also allows for an audit trail for future references.  
Step 3 ‚Äì SOFT V


--- Page 8 ---
‚Ä¢ 
SHAREHOLDERS AND DIRECTORS: information related to company 
shareholders and directors including the shareholders and directors' registers, 
IDs, CVs and proof of addresses 
Step 4: There could also be instances where documents are outstanding or additional 
documents is required or clarity sought. In such cases the assessor must be specific in the 
communication with the applicant. 
 
Step 5 ‚Äì RISK SCORING: After all checks are completed on a prospective applicant, a risk 
score is assigned to the entity.  
 
Onboarding Scores 
Lowest 26 / Highest 100 
Risk scale  
Low 26 - <40 
Medium >40 - <55 
High >55 - <70 
Alert!  > 70 
 
This score allows the organisation to determine whether the applicant falls within the risk 
appetite of the business. Additionally, it provides guidance on the frequency of due diligence 
reviews to be conducted on the applicant.  
The below table provides guidance on the criteria and aspects taken into account during the 
risk scoring process and how risk

(c) Does the Client or beneficial owner 
have links to sectors that involve 
significant amounts of cash? 
YES = 3 
 NO = 1 
 Unsure = 2 
(d) Where the Client is a legal person or 
legal arrangement, what is the nature of 
their business? ** 
Prohibited Industry = 5  
High Risk Industry = 4 
Medium Risk Industry = 3 
Low Risk Industry = 1 
Unsure = 2 
(e) Does the Client have political 
connections, or is the beneficial owner a 
PEP? Does the Client or beneficial owner 
have any other relevant links to a PEP, 
for example, are any of the Client‚Äôs 
directors PEPs and, if so, do these PEPs 
exercise significant control over the 
Client or beneficial owner? *** 
YES = 5 
 NO = 1 
 Unsure = 2 
  
(f) Does the Client or beneficial owner 
hold another prominent position or 
enjoy a high public profile that might 
enable them to abuse this position for 
private gain? For example, are they 
senior local or regional public officials 
with the ability to influence the awarding 
of public contrac


--- Page 10 ---
(j) Is the Client‚Äôs or the beneficial owner‚Äôs 
background consistent with what the 
firm knows about their former, current 
or planned business activity, their 
business‚Äôs turnover, the source of funds 
and the Client‚Äôs or beneficial owner‚Äôs 
source of wealth? 
YES = 1 
 NO = 3 
 Unsure = 2 
  
1.2 Relevant risk factors 
when considering the 
risk associated with a 
client‚Äôs or beneficial 
owners‚Äô reputation: 
(a) Are there adverse media reports or 
other relevant sources of information 
about the Client, for example, are there 
any allegations of criminality or terrorism 
against the Client or the beneficial 
owner? If so, are these reliable and 
credible? The financial institution should 
determine the credibility of allegations 
on the basis of the quality and 
independence of the source of the data 
and the persistence of reporting of these 
allegations, among other considerations.  
YES = 3 
 NO = 1 
 Unsure = 2 
  
(b) Has the Client, beneficial owner or 
anyone publicly known to


--- Page 11 ---
beneficial owner‚Äôs 
nature and behaviour.

might seek to avoid the establishment of 
a business relationship? For example, 
does the Client look to carry out one 
transaction or several one-off 
transactions where the establishment of 
a business relationship might make more 
economic sense? 
YES = 3 
 NO = 1 
 Unsure = 2 
  
(c) Is the Client‚Äôs ownership and control 
structure transparent and does it make 
sense? If the Client‚Äôs ownership and 
control structure is complex or opaque, 
is there an obvious commercial or lawful 
rationale?  
YES = 1 
 NO = 3 
 Unsure = 2 
  
(d) Do the Client issue bearer shares or 
does it have nominee shareholders? 
YES = 3 
 NO = 1 
 Unsure = 2  
(e) Is the Client a legal person or legal 
arrangement that could be used as a 
personal asset holding vehicle? 
YES = 3 
 NO = 1 
 Unsure = 2  
(f) Is there a sound reason for changes in 
the Client‚Äôs ownership and control 
structure?

 NO = 3 
 Unsure = 2

Step 8: Irrespective of the decision of the application, the outcome must be communicated to 
the applicant. In the case of a negative result, it is recommended to first have a discussion with 
the internal stakeholder, who will be best placed to decide on who should communicate the 
results with the applicant. If there is a compliance fail, we may not disclose the reason for the 
decline as this could be seen as tipping off which goes against AML/CTF regulations. In such a 
scenario we‚Äôd note that the application does not fall within the risk appetite of the business.  
In the event of a successful outcome, we would also discuss with the

5.2 Monitoring requirements 
Ongoing monitoring will be conducted similarly to the onboarding exercise via Klearium.  
For UK firms regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC), ongoing monitoring is a critical component of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 
compliance. Ongoing monitoring is designed to detect suspicious activities, update customer 
risk assessments, and ensure that firms remain compliant with AML and Counter-Terrorism 
Financing (CTF) obligations. 
Elements for on-going monitoring will included;  
1. Transaction Monitoring: UK firms are required to monitor transactions on an ongoing 
basis, focusing on detecting any patterns or unusual activity that may indicate potential 
money laundering or terrorism financing. This includes monitoring transaction sizes, 
volumes, and frequency, as well as comparing them to the customer‚Äôs established 
profile. 
2. Customer Risk Re-assessment: Customer risk levels are not static and must be 
reviewed

Comply Advantage 
Comply Advantage is an external paid for system, which we utilize as a 
screening tool to verify the authenticity and validate the status, as far as 
it extends to Money Laundering, sanctions and political exposure of 
individuals and entities.   
Bank Focus 
We utilize this screening tool to validate the authenticity of financial 
institutions and its affiliated executives. The system provides insights into 
the historical and current hierarchy of a financial institution. It also 
provides insights into sanctioned entities and is additionally used to 
assess and verify a financial institution‚Äôs financial status.

7. REPORTING 
Per POCA 2002, should suspicious activity, documentation or reasonable ground for suspicion 
become evident during any stage of onboarding, the assessor must make an internal disclosure 
to the MLRO.  The assessor must:  
a) consider obtaining EDD in accordance with MLR Regulations 2017; and 
(b) make an internal disclosure in accordance with the procedures established under POCA 
2002, part 7. 
The reporting procedures as above must also apply to prospective customers and transactions 
that were attempted but that did not take place. The steps to follow for an internal disclosure is 
covered in the procedural document for suspicious reporting. 
The MLRO will consider the internal disclosure to assess whether an exte
