approach is essential for adhering to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism
financing (CTF) laws.
4. ONBOARDING
4.1 What does the onboarding process entail?
Onboarding refers to the process of gathering information from a potential participant/ service
provider, assessing the information provided against external data sources and making a
decision/ judgement based on predefined criteria on the suitability & viability of the applicant
in relation to the organizational risk appetite. This process is also commonly known as the
vetting process. Compliance to legislative and regulatory standards is of utmost importance
and an irrefutable part of the decision-making process.
The vetting process typically falls within 2 categories i.e., i) Soft Vetting and ii) Extreme Vetting
4.2 Soft Vet

entity. A soft vet allows the organization to perform an initial assessment to determine whether

4.5 Onboarding steps
The procedure to follow when conducting a compliance vet, can be found in the steps
articulated below.
Step 1: The Compliance team will receive a request from Business Development for a new
onboarding. The initial request will be for a soft vet in which case if successful, an extreme
betting must be conducted.
Step 2: It is recommended for each request to be acknowledged. Not only is it polite and builds
report, but it also allows for an audit trail for future references.
Step 3 ‚Äì SOFT VETTING: On Klearium, under Compliance vet

‚Ä¢ SHAREHOLDERS AND DIRECTORS: information related to company
shareholders and directors including the shareholders and directors' registers,
IDs, CVs and proof of addresses
Step 4: There could also be instances where documents are outstanding or additional
documents is required or clarity sought. In such cases the assessor must be specific in the
communication with the applicant.
Step 5 ‚Äì RISK SCORING: After all checks are completed on a prospective applicant, a risk
score is assigned to the entity.
Lowest 26 / Highest 100
Risk scale
Low 26 - <40
Onboarding Scores
Medium >40 - <55
High >55 - <70
Alert! > 70
This score allows the organisation to determine whether the applicant falls within the risk
appetite of the business. Additionally, it provides guidance on the frequency of due diligence
reviews to be conducted on the applicant.
The below table provides guidance on the criteria and aspects taken into account during the
risk scoring process and how risk scores are allocated.

Step 8: Irrespective of the decision of the application, the outcome must be communicated to
the applicant. In the case of a negative result, it is recommended to first have a discussion with
the internal stakeholder, who will be best placed to decide on who should communicate the
results with the applicant. If there is a compliance fail, we may not disclose the reason for the
decline as this could be seen as tipping off which goes against AML/CTF regulations. In such a
scenario we‚Äôd note that the application does not fall within the risk appetite of the business.
In the event of a successful outcome, we would also discuss with the internal stakeho

5.2 Monitoring requirements
Ongoing monitoring will be conducted similarly to the onboarding exercise via Klearium.
For UK firms regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Revenue & Customs
(HMRC), ongoing monitoring is a critical component of Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
compliance. Ongoing monitoring is designed to detect suspicious activities, update customer
risk assessments, and ensure that firms remain compliant with AML and Counter-Terrorism
Financing (CTF) obligations.
Elements for on-going monitoring will included;
1. Transaction Monitoring: UK firms are required to monitor transactions on an ongoing
basis, focusing on detecting any patterns or unusual activity that may indicate potential
money laundering or terrorism financing. This includes monitoring transaction sizes,
volumes, and frequency, as well as comparing them to the customer‚Äôs established
profile.
2. Customer Risk Re-assessment: Customer risk levels are not static and must be
reviewed periodically. Th

SYSTEM PURPOSE
Comply Advantage Comply Advantage is an external paid for system, which we utilize as a
screening tool to verify the authenticity and validate the status, as far as
it extends to Money Laundering, sanctions and political exposure of
individuals and entities.
Bank Focus We utilize this screening tool to validate the authenticity of financial
institutions and its affiliated executives. The system provides insights into
the historical and current hierarchy of a financial institution. It also
provides insights into sanctioned entities and is additionally used to
assess and verify a financial institution‚Äôs financial status.
Google Google is freely available to check on applicants‚Äô websites, social or
general media.
Know Your Country This data source is freely available to internet users. It provides insights
into jurisdiction reports focussing on:
‚ùñ Transparency Int. Index/ Country Ratings table ‚Äì the jurisdiction

‚ùñ Sanctions ‚Äì the FATF status of the jurisdiction

Websites by sound boarding it against the relevant jurisdiction‚Äôs website.
7. REPORTING
Per POCA 2002, should suspicious activity, documentation or reasonable ground for suspicion
become evident during any stage of onboarding, the assessor must make an internal disclosure
to the MLRO. The assessor must:
a) consider obtaining EDD in accordance with MLR Regulations 2017; and
(b) make an internal disclosure in accordance with the procedures established under POCA
2002, part 7.
The reporting procedures as above must also apply to prospective customers and transactions
that were attempted but that did not take place. The steps to follow for an internal disclosure is
covered in the procedural document for suspicious reporting.
The MLRO will consider the internal disclosure to assess whether an external disclosure need
